Happiness Index Report

My project is focused on identifying the societal factors that the government will need to focus on for bringing society together to produce a sense of relief and happiness. The Happiness Index Project is a valuable resource for determining the societal factors that influenced a country's happiness index. I combined two data frames from the happiness index's surveys from 2019 and 2020. I validated that the variables matched up and removed any incompatible variables, identified the missing values, outliers, and unusual distributions. Source Kaggle - The HappinessIndex.xlsx
